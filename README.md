# WorkflowEnabler

🚀 **Manage your Dynamics 365 workflows quickly and easily!**

This tool helps administrators and developers to activate, deactivate, and manage Dynamics 365 workflows efficiently.

---

## Features

- Load workflows from a selected solution  
- Activate or deactivate multiple workflows at once  
- Export workflow details to CSV  
- Filter and search for specific workflows  

---

## How to use Multi-Select

WorkflowEnabler allows you to **select multiple workflows at once** to perform bulk actions such as activation or deactivation.

### Selecting multiple workflows

You can use standard Windows selection shortcuts:

- **Single selection**  
  Click on a workflow row to select one item.

- **Multiple non-consecutive selection**  
  Hold **Ctrl** and click on each workflow you want to select.

- **Multiple consecutive selection**  
  Click on the first workflow, then hold **Shift** and click on the last one to select all workflows in between.

### Performing bulk actions

Once multiple workflows are selected:

1. Click **Activate** to enable all selected workflows  
2. Click **Deactivate** to disable all selected workflows  

The action will be applied to **all selected workflows in one operation**.

## Tips

- Use the **search and filter** options to quickly narrow down workflows before using multi-select  
- Bulk actions are especially useful when deploying solutions across environments (DEV / TEST / PROD)  
- Exporting to CSV works with both single and multi-selection
